In order to continue assembly on my Track & Field cabinet, I need to route out some speaker/vent holes before I can attach any more pieces. Unfortunately, I'm not sure how to do it.

First, I bought a "panel pilot" router bit for my plunge router and then spent about thirty minutes trying to understand how the router motor and bit attach to the plunging stand which all came in the kit.

I wasn't expecting this to work, but I thought I'd try a shot at just doing a freehanded speaker vent slot. As you can see, it did not go well.

My plunge router base has a flat edge, so for attempt two, I realized I could just clamp down a straight edge and use it as a guide. The results were better, but I still needed pmore practice.

You can see that my third attempt was much better. The difference between the second and third attempts was that I used lots of shallow passes instead of fewer deep cuts. Routing out a little at a time made it easier to keep control of the router.

I was ready to move on and start creating some finished slots, but I knew that my best shot at getting reproducible results was to make a jig.

I wasn't at all sure how I was going to accomplish this, but I developed a plan after some careful thinking.

I took a scrap piece of wood and put my plunging base onto 3/4 of the wood. I think traced around the back of the base and the flat site. This would allow me to make a backstop and also establish a starting line for my straight edge. Using my square, I lengthened the line and using my plunge base, I placed a mark about where the bit would eventually be positioned. I marked this as zero -- the starting point for my routing. I was able to quickly mark off four mour inches. Not having any measurements of the slots, and using my 4" speakers, I took a guess that the slots should be about 3 3/4" long. I marked this off on my jig and then drew a straight line out across the board.

By placing the plunge base on my 3 3/4" pencil marks, I was able to then trace around the top of the base eventually becoming my forestop.

Using my jigsaw  I was able to cut away the extra and voila, a jig to help me make repeatable cuts. By slidiing down the jig a bit I am able to make very simlar cuts.

You can see that my second "real" slot isn't quite aligned with the first, but I think I'll be able to even those out later.




It's been over a week since I've been able to work on my Track & Field build because my kids had a hectic soccer camp schedule and now the weather isn't cooperating again. I've been making some minor changes to this site in the meantime, and I thought today I'd do a post on the cost of my build.

When I took on this project, one of the reasons I was interested was the cost. I knew that a relatively rare Track & Field cabinet would be fairly pricey and likely involve shipping costs plus whatever renovation expenses I incurred. The proof is in the pudding as they say so I've been maintaining a [Google Sheet to keep track of my expenses](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1S5zE5Ain3i2G2y6YvyH4oL3lOUQmubdFgGODNBmjnvY/edit?usp=sharing).

Expenses have far exceeded what I anticipated. I'm relatively certain that I could have bought a used cabinet and refurbished it myself for about the same cost and had an authentic unit.

The good news is that a large percentage of these costs were tool investments: jigsaw, plunge router, etc. I have to mentally weigh these costs differently because I tried to purchase quality tools that should outlast me and are useful beyond this project. This also means my next project should be significantly cheaper.

I’ve lost money on some judgement errors, like buying gear to go down the wrong path only to end up correcting course later. See [my Keep it Simple Stupid post](/2016/06/14/keep-it-simple.html) for more on that.

Overall, I'm not regretting my decision because I've had a lot of fun on this adventure: scrutinizing youtube videos; playing with the Rasberry Pi; sharing my experiences on this site -- all of this has been a great time and I'm still not finished.

While reviewing my costs keep in mind that there are some necessities I already had and didn't count. My table saw, circular saw and miscellaneous parts are examples of costs you won't see on my spreadsheet. I included a couple of other sheets to break out the costs of my mistakes and costs for reusable parts. If you're looking to do a build of your own, it should help you ballpark the costs.

Keep in mind that if you’re reading these as I’m posting them I’m still adding to the sheet as I build.

That's all for now. Hopefully time and weather will start cooperating and I can get some fabrication done and shared with you.
